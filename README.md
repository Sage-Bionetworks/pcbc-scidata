# Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium Scientific Data publication supplement

The Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium  [(PCBC)](http://www.progenitorcells.org/) is a [NHLBI](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/) sponsored effort to identify and characterize progenitor cell lineages, to direct the differentiation of stem and progenitor cells to desired cell fates, and to develop new strategies to address the unique challenges presented by the transplantation of these cells. A portal hosted in Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/pcbc) distributes data, results and analytical tools for the centrally characterized cell lines by the Cincinnati Cell Characterization Core (C4) as well as those generated by PCBC hub sites in collaboration with the bioinformatics core. 

This repository contains scripts used for preparation of Nature Scientific Data submission for the Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium.
